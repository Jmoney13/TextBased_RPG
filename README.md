# TextBased_RPG That I Call "Dungeony Dungeon"
  this was a my idea for my final Java Senior Project at Eastland-Fairfield Career Center
this Program is a simple choose your own adventure style game. where A user can Choose
their own class. 

* Soldier
* Tank
* Archer
* Wizard

Each of these classes have different move sets and different Health Point amounts.
after the user chooses a class they will enter a room and be faced against an enemy with 
its own set of moves and health points. Once either the player or the enemy is defeated they 
will be given a **You Lose!** or **You Win!** screen and asked if they would like to play again
which brings them back to the very beginning choosing which class they wanna choose.
